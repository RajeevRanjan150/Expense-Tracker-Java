# Expense-Tracker-Java
A simple Java console-based Expense Tracker project.

#Features:
~ Set a budget
~ Add expenses by category(Food/Travel/Shopping/Other)
~ View all expenses
~ Monthly summary with total spending
~ Biggest expense detection

#About Me:
~ I'm 14 years old and currently in 9th grade. I've been teaching myself Java programming, and this project is part of my journey to improve my coding skills.
 While this code may not be perfect, it represents the effort and logic I've learned so far. I'm open to learning from feedback and improving with time.

 #How to Run:
 1. Copy the code into a file named Main.java
 2. Compile: javac Main.java
 3. Run: java Main

#Notes:
~ Built with static variables and modular methods for simplicity.
~ This is an early version and can be made more dynamic in the future (e.g., using ArrayList or file storage).
~ Constructive feedback is welcome!

#Future Plans:
~ Implement ArrayList to make expense handling dymanic
~ Add file handling for saving and loading expenses
~ Create a more interactive menu system
~ Explore GUI frameworks to build a user-friendly interface
